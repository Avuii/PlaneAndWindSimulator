# PlaneAndWindSimulator

A simple flight simulation tool that calculates aircraft travel time along a defined route, both with and without wind influence.

## Description

This program generates a random 2D wind vector field and simulates the flight of an aircraft across a series of waypoints. It compares the travel time in two scenarios:

- Without wind (constant aircraft velocity),
- With wind influence (aircraft velocity adjusted by wind vectors).

All input and output data are saved to `.txt` and `.csv` files.

## Features

- Random 2D wind field generation,
- Multi-point route support,
- Travel time calculation with/without wind,
- Data export to text and CSV formats.

## Output Example

- **Route:** A → B → C  
- **Results:**
  - Time without wind: `XX s`
  - Time with wind: `YY s`
  - Difference: `ZZ s`
